    "* The economist [Thomas Piketty argues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century) that we have entered an age where the return on capital is greater than the growth due to income, and that this leads to higher inequality. We could incorporate income into the model by assigning each individual $i$ a per-timestep income $g_i$, where the $g_i$ are randomly chosen _a priori_. We could incorporate return on capital into the model, by multiplying wealth by a growth factor every timestep (and rescaling income to account for inflation). Investigate what happens when we combine these two extensions. How well correlated are income and wealth? How does the relationship depend on capital growth rate? Do you agree with Piketty? Does taxation alter the relationship?"
